Disaster Risk Reduction projects focus on mitigating or reducing the impact of natural disasters on local communities. HOT works with communities and disaster management agencies to map and understand risk by developing comprehensive data sets on buildings, roads, and key lifeline infrastructure data. Data can be used in [InaSAFE](http://inasafe.org/) to produce realistic natural hazard impact scenarios for better planning, preparedness and response activities across multiple hazards such as hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes/cyclones and volcanic eruptions.
