The world is witnessing the highest levels of displacement on record, with 65.5 million people forced from home, among them 22.5 million refugees. Refugees are often resettling outside of traditional camps in cities and host communities. The need for maps which track human displacement, resettlement, and access to services has become vital to these new, geographically dispersed responses. OpenStreetMap is used by UNHCR and humanitarian agencies in decisions that improve conditions for refugees, and by refugees themselves to navigate their new environments.
