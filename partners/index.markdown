## Want to grow your volunteering program?

**Corporate social responsibility & employee engagement: join the Missing Maps project!** Digital volunteering to map vulnerable unmapped places: demonstrate your organization’s values and commitment through mapping as an employee volunteering opportunity.  

 
### Why?  

- Cause: Each year, disasters around the world kill nearly 100,000 and affect or displace 200 million people. Many of the places where these disasters occur are literally ‘missing’ from any map and first responders lack the information to make valuable decisions regarding relief efforts.

- Ease: mapping is done using simple online tools. We provide training to help you get set up, and ensure employees are comfortable running events.

- Scale: unite your global offices and remote workers to volunteer together, mapping on the same projects.

- Micro-volunteering: have an impact with as little as one hour of volunteering

- Impact: mapping is one of the only ways for volunteers to be directly involved in major crises happening in other countries. Mapping provides measurable outputs to understand your impact. Additionally, through mapping you can support a wide range of organisations and global issues, broadening the opportunities available to your volunteers.

### How?


- Partner with us to map vulnerable places before the next disaster strikes to increase resiliency and support international development, and participate in disaster response. We will support you to engage your employees in mapping as a micro-volunteering activity, setting up large-scale remote and in person mapping events, connecting all your offices in the same mission. Mapping is simple and fun, all you need is a laptop, and 20 minutes of training to get started!

## Need data for field programs?

**Humanitarian and Development Organisations, or need data for a project?** We rapidly create datasets at large scale, both in field programs and remotely. Our methodology works directly with community data collectors to gather data on the places they live and work, ensuring data accuracy, and enabling you to answer different questions through hyper local knowledge.

### Why?

- **Speed:** we are a nimble organisation, able to set up projects in our existing country offices or new locations very quickly.

- **Ease & Scalability:** working with community members we are able to reach scale very quickly, and ensure our data collection is ethical and appropriate to local context

- **Answer any question:** our methodology works across a huge range of issues, both physical environment mapping and qualitative data gathering. Examples of current projects include sanitation access, service access for refugees, flood risk, infectious disease & healthcare.

- **Sustainability:** through working with local community members and supporting local OpenStreetMap communities, we encourage data sustainability far beyond the project lifetime

- **Impact:**
