### Employee volunteering

Demonstrate your organization’s values and commitment to your community by partnering with HOT.

Each year, disasters around the world kill nearly 100,000 and affect or displace 200 million people. Many of the places where these disasters occur are literally 'missing' from any map and first responders lack the information to make valuable decisions regarding relief efforts. Using simple online tools, your employees can help to map areas where humanitarian organisations are trying to meet the needs of vulnerable people.

### Why?

- **Remote volunteering:** volunteers can contribute from anywhere in the world, individually or in groups

- **Micro volunteering:** volunteers can contribute for as little or as long as they like, and can get started quickly after a short online training.

- Impact: <directly involved in field>

- Scale: <huge events>

### Part 1: Become a Missing Maps Partner

- **What:** Map vulnerable places before the next disaster strikes to increase resiliency and support international development

- How: We will support you to engage your employees in mapping as a micro-volunteering activity, setting up large scale remote and in person mapping events, connecting all your offices in the same mission. Mapping is simple and fun, all you need is a laptop, and 20 minutes of training to get started!

### Part 2: Become an Disaster Partner

- **What:** When a disaster happens, it’s often hard for companies to respond. Working with HOT, when disasters strike, your employees can map places affected.

- **How:** We will support you to set up mapping as a disaster response offering in your organisation. Many people want to help when disaster strikes, but the only option they have is to donate money. Through mapping, employees are directly involved in disaster response activities, creating maps used immediately by relief organisations including the Red Cross and Doctors Without Borders worldwide.
