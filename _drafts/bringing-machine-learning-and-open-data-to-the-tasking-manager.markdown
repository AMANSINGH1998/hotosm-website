Last month we kicked off a new phase for the Tasking Manager -- building a community of collaborators for software development. The community is addressing usability and user flows, metrics and statistics, and machine learning. Today we're sharing about a [new partnership with Microsoft Philanthropies and Bing Maps](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/ai-for-humanitarian-action) to bring design updates, machine learning integration, and new open building datasets into the Tasking Manager.

## Why does this matter?

Hundreds of millions of map features critical for humanitarian responses are missing from the map. The HOT community maps at an incredible rate but we have a lot of work to do to improve data quality and still have large parts of the world unmapped. To meet this need, the process of how we map OpenStreetMap through the Tasking Manager needs enhancements.

At the HOT Summit in September 2018, we held a [workshop about machine learning integration](https://www.hotosm.org/updates/integrating-machine-learning-into-the-tasking-manager/) into a Tasking Manager mapping workflow. A key point of the discussions at the workshop was the appropriate use of machine learning outputs into the mapping workflow. We identified priority areas to work on with the key being that the focus on the near term would be to improve data quality checks and mapping guidance.

Our partnership with Microsoft comes out of the discussions at the HOT Summit and later work at SatSummit to help bring developer and design resources to OSM to address machine learning integration. Along with ML integration, Microsoft will be creating country-wide open building datasets by building upon the work they’ve done in the US and Canada. This will be one of the first open building datasets in Africa that will be available for use with OSM.

## What you're going to see worked on over the life of the project?

Over the next seven months, the partnership will work on the following:

1. Conduct design research and enhance the Tasking Manager for improved mapping workflows with machine learning
2. Build a machine learning API for integrating outputs into the Tasking Manager
3. Create country-wide open building datasets in Uganda and Tanzania
4. Pilot a feedback loop to help improve data models and outputs

We’ve kicked off the first two items in February and you’ll begin to see outputs over the next month. This work is a part of the increase in development on the Tasking Manager from contributing organizations and we’re having [bi-weekly working group meetings](https://github.com/hotosm/tasking-manager/wiki/TM-Working-Group-Meeting-Details) and an active [Slack channel](https://slack.hotosm.org/) discussions (#ml4tm and #tasking_manager_3 channels).

## What's Next?

There are a couple items to keep on the lookout in the near term:

1. [User flow research](https://github.com/hotosm/projects/issues/12) from the design group [Major.](http://wegomajor.com/) We’ve been working with a Lisbon-based interaction design firm called Major to research and evaluate how users move through the system.

2. A deep dive into Tasking Manager data. As we’ve been working with Major, we’ve been looking into the data about task completion, validation, and other metrics about speed and coverage of mapping.

All this new work is thanks in part to the American Red Cross and the work they’ve done with Microsoft through the Missing Maps project. American Red Cross is a key partner in the project and will be helping work with us as we implement the work on the Tasking Manager.
