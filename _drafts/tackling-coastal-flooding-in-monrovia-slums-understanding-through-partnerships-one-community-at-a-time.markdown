In the informal settlements of Liberia’s largest city, [Open Cities Africa](http://opencitiesproject.org) is introducing a dynamic open data workflow to support urban planning and protect residents from floods.

Monrovia is home to a growing population of 1.3 million inhabitants. Flanked on either side by the Atlantic Ocean and mangrove-filled Mesurado and Saint Paul rivers, the capital city has few options for expansion. Two out of three Monrovians reside in the unplanned and slum communities in lowlands and swamps along the Stockton Creek and Du River banks, including Slipway, Doe Community, Saye Town, Logan Town, Clara and Via Towns, and the famed West Point.

Population growth, combined with internal migration from a 14 year long civil war, has led to the rapid expansion of informal settlements in high-risk zones of Monrovia. Today their placement in low-elevation coastal areas and swampy flood-prone land has become a dangerous factor for residents’ health and employment. In some slum communities, heavy rainfall and low elevations mean year-round flooding.

Almost 90 percent of the population is living at risk of flooding from the sea, river system, swampland and clogged drains. During the flood period, kids are unable to leave homes to attend school nor is there a space to sit nor play, while the men have to walk through unhygienic floods in search of food. Families, particularly children and women, are hit by cases of malaria, diarrhea, and cholera - all worsened by these waters. Waste and sanitation services are limited, furthering these threats. Few shared toilets exist in the communities, leaving more than 80 percent of residents to practice open defecation in locations exposed to flood. There are no sources of clean drinking water and extremely restricted mobility restricts waste collection and emergency access. During one of our community engagements, Madam Mariah K. Abu, Chairlady of Doe Community Women Association, described her family’s four days displacement from their home due to high water levels.

Attempts to resettle vulnerable communities are complicated by the fact that most residents’ income sources are found in these and neighboring wards: most working in petty trade, temporary odd jobs, street vending, sand mining, port-related employment, small-scale industries,  and subsistence fishing. Several [donor-funded projects](http://knowyourcity.info/explore-our-data/country/?country=liberia) have been geared towards these slum communities in an attempt to address these diverse issues. However, most of these mapping activities over the years, including during the Ebola Virus Disease outbreak, were primarily focused on building footprints, and final products were kept as a silo, even from the communities from where they were collected.

> “We believe this project is taking an innovative approach to ensure...we will have access to our own information to help us drive and dictate our development that will benefit every resident”.

Addressing this challenge requires innovative, open, and dynamic data collection and mapping processes to support the management of urban growth and [disaster risk](https://www.gfdrr.org/index.php/en/acp-eu/strengthening-disaster-risk-management-in-liberia). The [Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team](https://www.hotosm.org/) (HOT) is excited to team up with tech hub [iLab Liberia](https://www.ilabliberia.org/) and [OSM Liberia](https://twitter.com/osmliberia) - the local community of OSM contributors in Liberia - to introduce the [Open Cities Monrovia project](https://opencitiesproject.org/monrovia/): generating data to help unplanned settlements and slum communities be more resilient to flooding and other natural disasters.

The Open Cities participatory mapping aligns with GFDRR’s Resilient Cities Program through a unique partnership between the World Bank and city governments to enhance upcoming or ongoing World Bank supported projects in Monrovia, thereby creating and releasing open spatial data about the built environment, critical infrastructure, and natural hazards. The project will assist key stakeholders like the [Liberia National Red Cross Society](https://www.icrc.org/en/where-we-work/africa/liberia), City Corporation, and [National Disaster Management Agency](http://ndmaliberia.org/) to utilize risk data towards addressing natural disaster risk in Monrovia through evidence-driven urban resilience interventions. The exercise is inclusive and is based on the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team open data model. Data collected will update [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) (OSM) and will be publicly available for repurposing.
