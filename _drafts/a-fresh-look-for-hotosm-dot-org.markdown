Today we flipped the switch on a new look for hotosm.org. The new hotosm.org has updated information on projects, new ways of accessing information about the community, and most of all maps!

### Projects, stats, and maps

The new hotosm.org has a number of new views that focus helping communicate what HOT does, who the HOT community is, and how to get directed to the right place.

Within the Our Work section, you’ll find information about where and who makes up the HOT community. We’ve integrated a map view that allows navigation to countries and projects.

In addition to project information, we’ve integrated the Missing Maps API to give access to country level OSM editing. This shows the mapping activity across OSM that is happening within every country. 

### Implementing a process to design and build

Over a year ago, Felix Delattre and I discussed ideas and options for how we can reduce maintenance and overhead of keeping our Drupal site up and secure. After our discussion, we agreed at looking into other options and we began a process of not only looking at the technology behind the website but also conduct a design update. Since last summer, the website working group has been engaging in a process that has taken us from research and strategy phase, to designing and developing a prototype with designer Brendan Gatens, and now has finished not only content migration but with the Communications Working Group engaging with HOT and OSM community projects to have their information highlighted and accessible on the website. 

On the technical side, the entire site is built using Jekyll, a simple static site generator. We’ve integrated a content editor called Siteleaf, which gives us the ability to add another option of editing beyond Github. 

### What’s Next

The new hotosm.org is an updated way of how our community provides accessible information and data. Rebuilding the website gives us a foundation to incorporate more feedback and ideas going forward. 

Over the next month one of our Outreachy interns, Ramya, is working on updated stats and integrating additional data into more map views across project and country pages.
