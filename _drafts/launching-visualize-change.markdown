Today we’re launching Visualize Change, a new tool to see the change of OpenStreetMap over time. Anyone can automate the creation of embedded and downloadable animations of change in OSM. At FOSS4G last week, we showed it off and this week we’re sharing it to the wider OpenStreetMap community. 

Visualizing OSM data is helpful for quickly analyzing what and where data has changed. This gives HOT projects and the community the ability to assess an area, or share with a partner about what work is happening. There are a lot of tools out there to visualize snapshots of OSM data, compare two points in time, or watch OSM data be edited in real-time. There are even the incredible ITO World animations that have been periodically made — including one recent of Indonesia. Drawing inspiration from ITO World and the Latest Changes tool (from Martin Raifer), we wanted to take the first step at making it easier for anyone to create time-based animations to see progress or share what has changed within an area. Visualize Change is the result of that work.

## Visualizing change across Open Cities Africa projects

We soft-launched the tool late this Spring and have been honing features and testing across the ten Open Cities Africa projects where we are supporting the World Bank. Check them out below:
