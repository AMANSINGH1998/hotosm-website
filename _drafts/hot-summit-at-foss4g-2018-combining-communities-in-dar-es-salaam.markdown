This year’s HOT Summit was unique for many reasons, it was the first held in Africa and the first to be integrated into and part of the international FOSS4G conference. HOT’s Summit Working Group and the Dar Local Organizing Committee (DLOC) of OSGeo worked together to combine the OpenStreetMap and OSGeo communities and create unique opportunities for discussion and collaboration. Combining their efforts, the groups were excited to host dozens of new voices and include more supported participants than ever before.\

With 13% of the 1000\+ conference-goers attending with a Travel Grant, FOSS4G 2018 was a turning point in dialogue on inclusion and diversity in the open source geospatial community. 137 Travel Grants, the majority awarded to women from East Africa, positively impacted the range of diversity amongst the conference attendees.
