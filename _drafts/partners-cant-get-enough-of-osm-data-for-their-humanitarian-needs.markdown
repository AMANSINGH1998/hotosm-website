Summary Text: 'HOT is currently in a round of development for the Export Tool looking
  to improve overall functionality. Streamlining the infrastructure and enhancing
  admin features are some of the key focuses, as we aim to increase volunteer participation
  and get a better understanding of how, where, what and when the service is being
  used, which will help pave the way for future rounds of development

There are many tools out there that help us create data in OpenStreetMap, whether you’re looking to outline building footprints or add attribute information to features. iD Editor and JOSM are some favourites for digitising features by tracing visible geometries from aerial imagery, while mobile phone applications like Maps.ME and OpenMapKit lets you add details to these features observed on the ground. But what about tools for when we want to use data from OSM?

There are some great tools out there, such as Overpass Turbo which is a powerful tool for querying and exporting OSM data for an area of interest into a variety of file formats. There is even GeoFabrik, a platform which hosts regularly updated OSM data extracts at the country and continent level. But every tool has its limitations, and Overpass Turbo is no exception. Although brilliant at querying and viewing OSM data, it can be slightly perplexing for users with little knowledge of OSM.

## A Tool Is Never Perfect!

This is why the Export Tool was conceived, to build an online tool that would allow users and our partners with little to no technical expertise or OSM knowledge to extract data easily. The tool allows users to define an area of interest and select map features through a tag tree.  Similar to a category tree with a hierarchical ‘Parent’ and ‘Child’ categories, a user does not have to know how tags are set up in OSM for map features and can simply select from a list of options. This is the aim, but just to reiterate - a tool is never perfect. Since its initial conception in 2015, it has undergone several rounds of development as we attempt to get it closer to delivering what a variety of users need.

## Match Made in Heaven

The last big round of development took place in 2017, which focused on opening up the tool for global exports, improving the way features are filtered, adding additional file formats and integrating the OSM2HDX extension to push datasets onto the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX) platform. The collaboration with HDX was a great success, enabling us to get OSM datasets to an even wider audience, which have gone on to be among the most downloaded datasets in 2018 and 2019! 

As we continue to support partner organisations respond to numerous crisis across the globe, we are looking to increase the usefulness of OSM datasets. Part of this includes breaking out the Points of Interests (POIs) datasets on HDX into standalone datasets for airports, health and education facilities, as well as the addition of populated places. This will help support the new ‘Data Grid’ feature from HDX, which aims to get the right data to the right people, depending on who is looking and what they are looking for.

HDX groups crisis data into six categories: 


* Affected people
* Coordination and context
* Food security and nutrition
* Geography and infrastructure
* Health and education
* Population and socio-economic indicators



The Data Grid looks at these datasets at the country level and assesses whether the data is in a common format, tidy, geo-spatially referenced, comprehensive, and up-to-date. Additional OSM datasets provided through the Export Tool will help support this.



## What is the Focus this Time Round?


This round of development looks at improving the overall functionality of the tool, with no major new features introduced. We are streamlining the infrastructure setup to help future deployments and encourage contributions from the public to improve the tool and better support a variety of use cases. A major focus is also on enhancing the Export Tool admin functionality, so that we can capture user statistics to get a better understanding of how, where, what and when the service is being used. This will help pave the way for future rounds of development.

The introduction of a secondary pipeline and priority queue system has been on the back burner for a while now, and is sorely needed to help reduce bottlenecks in the system and support the creation of exports as the demand for OSM datasets grows, particularly for country-wide datasets through HDX. Extracting, filtering and converting data into different file formats can be machine intensive and we are looking at ways to distribute the tasks a little more evenly across demands. Lastly, we will be building out a new extension that will push OSM data to the Pacific Disaster Center’s (PDC) InAWARE platform.  





## Helping Partners Access OSM Data


HOT has partnered with PDC since 2016 in Indonesia, focusing on the data collection of key lifeline infrastructure data in OSM. These datasets were then brought in as base maps to their early warning and decision support system, InAWARE, which is a customised version of their core DisasterWare product specifically for the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana (BNPB). As OSM data is always evolving to reflect changes occurring on the ground, it is important to ensure that the lifeline infrastructure base map is kept up-to-date. This can be an intensive manual procedure, so we are looking to automate the process for the whole of Indonesia, where previously data was only provided for the cities of Surabaya, Jakarta and Semarang.
