# HOT helps build technology capacity and provides support for open source mapping technologies and software

### What?

We provide training across data literacy, data use, and mapping, to strengthen your organisation to harness geospatial and citizen-generated data.

### Why?

* Capacity building: enable your staff to better leverage maps and geo data in their projects and programs.

* Innovation: harness new data and technology opportunities.

* Quick: with as little as a few days training teams are able to start implementing new methods.
