# HOT helps build technology capacity and provide support to help you use open source mapping technologies and software

### What?

We provide training across data literacy, data use, and mapping using multiple different tools and approaches, to strengthen your organisation's ability to harness geospatial and citizen-generated data.

### Why?

* **Capacity building**: enable your staff to better leverage maps and geo data in their projects and programs through data literacy and mapping training.

* **Innovation**: harness new data sources and technology opportunities to keep your organisation ahead. Through mapping, your projects can be truly participatory with community members and beneficiaries, and produce data at huge quality and scale.

* **Quick**: with as little as a few days training teams are able to start implementing new methods. The HOT Global network of staff, volunteers, and community members will support you ongoing.
