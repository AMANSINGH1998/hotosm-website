# HOT helps organizations engage employees through digital mapping volunteering  



Join the Missing Maps project to improve your employee engagment and Corporate Social Responsibility programs!

### What?

Digital volunteering to map vulnerable unmapped places: your global workforce can quickly get started, working together on the same activity!
 
### Why?
* **Cause**: Each year, disasters around the world kill nearly 100,000 and affect or displace 200 million people. Many of the places where these disasters occur are literally ‘missing’ from any map and first responders lack the information to make valuable decisions regarding relief efforts.

* **Ease**: mapping is done using simple online tools. We provide training to help you get set up, and ensure employees are comfortable mapping and running events.

* **Scale**: unite your global offices and remote workers to volunteer together on the same project.

* **Micro-volunteering**: have an impact with as little as one hour of volunteering.

* **Impact**: mapping is one of the only ways for volunteers to be directly involved in major crises happening in other countries. Mapping provides measurable outputs to understand your impact. Additionally, through mapping you can support a wide range of organisations and global issues, broadening the opportunities available to your volunteers.

### How?

* Partner with us to map vulnerable places before the next disaster strikes to increase resiliency and support international development, and participate in disaster response. We will support you to engage your employees in mapping as a micro-volunteering activity, setting up large-scale remote and in person mapping events, connecting all your offices in the same mission. Mapping is simple and fun, all you need is a laptop, and 20 minutes of training to get started!
