## About HOT
Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) is a US-based NGO and global community of thousands of volunteers working together to use maps and open data for humanitarian response and the Sustainable Development Goals. As the world’s preeminent participatory mapping NGO, HOT has fostered a global mapping community composed of more than 50,000 people with ground operations in five countries. When major disaster strikes anywhere in the world, HOT rallies this global network to create the maps and data that enable responders to reach those in need.

HOT is soliciting CVs of applicants for positions in Aruba for an anticipated project supporting an UNHCR initiative that can help in overcoming the data gaps and challenges in the Aruba and enhance the response to the Venezuela situation through gathering needed data and expanding analysis on the population characteristics, needs and their living conditions in the host countries.
 
## About the Position
The Associate Project Manager will lead HOT’s mapping, data collection, and training activities on the project in close coordination with other staff. This includes customizing and delivering in-person training, assisting with design of field data collection, and managing the work of 2 trainers and 20 surveyors.

This individual will ensure that data is up to date, correctly attributed and openly accessible, to facilitate the creation of comprehensive, highly detailed refugee-specific base maps for more effective advocacy, navigation, and service delivery.
S/he may also serve in a monitoring and evaluation capacity, ensuring that outputs and outcomes of project activities are appropriately captured in order to provide accurate, nuanced reporting to the donor. The position will involve management and manipulations of data across platforms, and reciprocations between Open and proprietary data formats. 
There will be a need for strong organisational skills, and understanding of the architectures of both traditional NGOs and the more multi-lateral tech methodologies. Candidates considered for this post will be able to show a capacity for an improvised yet orderly approach, involving the design of data management systems which are scalable, yet accommodate constraints dictated by resource-poor settings. This is a dynamic evolutionary post, located in an era which increasingly acknowledges Open Source Ethos as a contributing standard in the future of international disaster relief.
