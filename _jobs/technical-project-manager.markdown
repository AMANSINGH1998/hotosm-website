Free, up-to-date maps are a critical resource when relief organizations are responding to disasters or political crises. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) creates and provides those maps. When major disaster strikes anywhere in the world, HOT rallies a huge network of volunteers to create open data, online in OpenStreetMap, the maps that enable responders to reach those in need.

To conduct this work HOT builds and maintains over ten open source mapping tools. We work with volunteers and contributors to design and develop these products to serve the larger HOT and OpenStreetMap community. HOT is hiring a Technical Project Manager to oversee product development of these open source tools. This position will be based remotely with periodic travel to HOT’s offices.

As a product manager, you will develop a product roadmap, engage volunteers, facilitate developer meetings, and provide development coordination. This is an exciting role to lead the direction and development of HOT’s open source tools. Second is as a project manager providing financial and administrative oversight of grant funding and coordinate specific grant-funded activities.
