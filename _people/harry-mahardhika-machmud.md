Since he studies geography at university he uses his knowledge to make some simple analysis and interpretation about objects that he sees. He joined HOT because he wants to get some experience in mapping and working as a team with different people.&nbsp;</span><br style="color: #626262; font-family: Lato, Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; text-align: right; background-color: #f9f9f9;"><span style="color: #626262; font-family: Lato, Arial, Tahoma, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal; text-align: right; background-color: #f9f9f9;">He hopes can give maximum contribution to this project and help people make maps easier and for free. Think Spatial to be Special!</span></p>
