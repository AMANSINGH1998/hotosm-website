As HOT's Director of Community Projects, I'm overseeing all our mapping projects and communities. That includes our country teams and projects in Africa, SE Asia and beyond. With a background in software engineering and GIS/LBS (Location-based Services), I have been working with (open) geospatial data since around 2003, and started using OpenStreetMap professionally relatively early.

I've worked with HOT since 2015, originally managing mapping projects such as "Ramani Huria" in Tanzania, and have since continued supporting the growth and expansion of our communities and projects across the board. I immensely enjoy the combination of the educational aspects, local skills and capacity building, and supporting (local) governments and NGOs to incorporate open geospatial data into their thinking, policy and decision making in a wide range .
