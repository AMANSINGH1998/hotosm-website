<p>Courtney currently builds communities and OpenStreetMap's dataset in underserved communities as an Innovation Fellow at Peace Corps. Prior to joining Peace Corps as a staff member, she served as a Peace Corps Public Health volunteer in the Fouta region of Guinea from 2012-2014. She has been an active OSM contributor and HOT volunteer since September 2014, when she joined to help map Guinea during the height of the Ebola crisis. She is a HOT member and serves on the Communications Working Group, as well as helping organize the OSM Institutions group that works to integrate OSM data in institutional settings such as the US government and international NGOs.&nbsp;</p><p>Outside of mapping, Courtney loves reading, front-end web development, cycling around DC, kayaking around her native Michigan, traveling to see friends and family and daydreaming of the day she'll have a dog.&nbsp;</p>
