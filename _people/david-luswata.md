<p>David has spent the last over half a decade blending ICT with Geospatial data for government agencies, humanitarian organizations and education institutions. From preparing a nation for the National Population and Housing Census, to research firms conducting nation wide surveys, to helping nations recover from the worst disease outbreak of recent history [Ebola Virus Disease], he has seen GIS at play and much more appreciated the power of OpenData and the importance of mapping. David leads HOT's work in Liberia.</p>
