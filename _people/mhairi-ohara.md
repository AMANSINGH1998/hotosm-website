<p>I've worked with HOT on a number of projects and will always volunteer with such a great organisation. I recently had the honour of being the trainer and data specialist on the Gates project in Uganda which was focused on Mapping Financial Inclusion.</p><p>Other collaborations include project managing the Hewlett grant which involved overseeing the development of the Stamen Designs Field Papers, the HOT Export Tool, the Activation Curriculum and HOT's participation in the Outreachy program.</p><p>As an individual, I would say I am a GIS specialist with a healthy obsession of volcanoes, surfing, eating and promoting open source and open data. I also love interacting with people, seeking out new experiences, learning as much as I can and always striving to do better!</p><p><span style="color: #292f33; font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; background-color: #f5f8fa;">&nbsp;</span></p>
