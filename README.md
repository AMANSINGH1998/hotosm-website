This repo contains a copy of code powering the website http://hot.openstreetmap.org (The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team) 
## Drupal
This is actually just the Drupal codebase. Neither the Drupal core nor any of the module code has been patched. Most configuration is exported and committed as features. So far there is no additional development for the site, and it is doubtful that we would need that any time soon. So we are using this github repository as a deployment system rather than anything else. See README.txt for the normal Drupal readme file.

## Website issues
We could use the issue tracker at https://github.com/hotosm/hotosm-website/issues for website issues. Currently however we have website issues mixed with some others at https://github.com/hotosm/hotosm/issues (use the ['website' label](https://github.com/hotosm/hotosm/issues?labels=website&page=1&state=open))
