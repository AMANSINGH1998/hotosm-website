<p>It is morning in Venice, Italy. We are having a mini-mapathon in support of the Sri Lanka Flood actiation live from the <a href="https://understandrisk.org/ur2016-program/">Understanding Risk Conference</a>.&nbsp; At the event, a number of HOT members are here to participate in a panel: <a href="https://understandrisk.org/event-session/bridging-the-divide/">Bridging the divide: Digital humanitarians and the Nepal earthquake</a>.&nbsp; We wanted to do something to help so today we joined mini-mapathons that are happening in Asia - Nepal, India and Bangladesh. And, of course, in true HOT form, we are joining the global mappers by taking tiles via <a href="http://tasks.hotosm.org/project/1913">Task Manager</a>. Hope you can join us!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<img class="image-medium" src="/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/Mapping%20for%20the%20Sri%20Lanka%20Floods%20at%20Understanding%20Risk%20%28May%202016%29.jpg?itok=supF4zFf" alt="" width="220" height="114"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<img class="image-medium" src="/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/minimapathon%20understanding%20risk.jpeg?itok=VFJKJL25" alt="" width="220" height="124"></p><p>&nbsp;Thanks to the <a href="https://www.gfdrr.org/opendri">OpenDRI</a> team for arranging this opportunity to share with the Understanding Risk community while we support the current activation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
