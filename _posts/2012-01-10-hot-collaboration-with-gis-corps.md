<p>GIS Corps is joining together with HOT again for a joint project. &nbsp;The first collaboration between HOT and GIS Corps occurred during the Samoa exercise that happened earlier this year. &nbsp;Once again we are joining forces to work mapping Padang City in Indonesia. &nbsp;<a href="http://giscorps.org/">GIS Corps</a> is a volunteer organization that provides GIS Professionals as volunteers. &nbsp;They've been in existence since 2003 and have had about 2500 volunteers from 93 countries. &nbsp;We are are excited that 11 of their members are going to join us to help complete the <a href="http://tasks.hotosm.org/job/9">Help Map for a Safer Padang Task</a>&nbsp;(requires OpenStreetMap login). &nbsp;You can read a little bit more about those joining us, such as the countries they hail from on the <a href="http://www.giscorps.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=96&amp;Itemid=63">GIS Corps website</a>.</p><p>The goal of the effort is to map all the streets and buildings in Padang so that it can feed into risk models. &nbsp;The <a href="http://www.aifdr.org/">Australia-Indonesia Facility for Disaster Reduction (AIFDR)</a>&nbsp;can then use this information as the exposure component for risk modeling. &nbsp;Others can potentially also additionally build on the data easily using <a href="http://walking-papers.org/">Walking Papers</a> in the future as well.</p><p>We look forward to moving forward on this. &nbsp;Thanks for the help GIS Corps!</p><p><a href="http://hot.openstreetmap.org/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/gc_logo_comp_0.jpg"><img title="gc_logo_comp_0" src="http://hot.openstreetmap.org/weblog/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/gc_logo_comp_0.jpg" alt="" style="width:448px;height:156px"></a></p>
