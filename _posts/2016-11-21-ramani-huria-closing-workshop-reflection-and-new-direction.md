These maps have now been compiled into the form of an Atlas for Flood Resilience - received by all conference delegates upon arrival. The honourable Theresia Mmbando, Regional Administrative Secretary, and Osiligi Losai, Ward Executive Officer (WEO) of Kigogo, offered their remarks, congratulating all Ramani Huria team members on their accomplishments thus far and officially opening the workshop.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://ramanihuria.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_9938.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1812" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://ramanihuria.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_9938.jpg" alt="img_9938" style="width:5616px;height:3744px"></a><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Panelists</span></p><p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal;">The workshop largely took the form of four engaging panels that covered the topics of&nbsp;<em>Flooding in Dar es Salaam, Learning from Ramani Huria, Maps in an Urban Environment,&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Scaling Ramani Huria</em>. Within these panels, WEOs spoke about the participatory mapping process and how they have been using the maps to improve management of their wards, Disaster Managers commended the quality of the data produced by community mapping, professionals from international organizations offered their advice and support for scaling up, and representatives from major decision-making bodies in Tanzania announced their consideration of adopting community mapping as common practice and officially incorporating the Ramani Huria data into development plans.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://ramanihuria.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_0195-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1815" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://ramanihuria.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_0195-1.jpg" alt="RH Cafe" style="width:5616px;height:3744px"></a><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Nyambiri Kimacha of the Red Cross presenting at the RH Cafe</span></p><p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal;">Conference attendees initiated stimulating dialogue around all topics discussed. This dialogue was particularly present during the Ramani Huria Cafe, a unique session that allowed speakers to share their expertise in great detail with interested delegates over coffee and snacks. Another unique session incorporated into the event was the Forecast-Based Financing game, led by Julie Arrighi of the American Red Cross. This game introduced the concept of forecast-based financing - a system that uses the science of weather and climate to anticipate possible impacts in risk-prone areas and mobilize resources&nbsp;<em>before</em>&nbsp;an event - via an interactive activity that was accessible to all.</p><p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://ramanihuria.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_0110.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1813" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="http://ramanihuria.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IMG_0110.jpg" alt="img_0110" style="width:5616px;height:3744px"></a><span style="font-size: 8pt;">Isaya Mwita, Mayor of Dar es Salaam</span></p><p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal;">With the blessing of major government officials who made appearances at the workshop, from the Regional Administrative Secretary to the Mayor of Dar es Salaam Hon. Isaya Mwita, the Ramani Huria team is now tasked to formulate its plans for a scale-up with its partners - through which it will be extending its reach geographically and expanding its focus beyond flood resilience. The project will continue to grow its partnerships - both local and international - to ensure that the value of community involvement spreads within the realms of urban planning and development, and that Tanzania leads the world in innovative techniques for mapping.</p><p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal;">Presentations, photos, and other resources will be available soon at <a href="ramanihuria.org/conference" target="_blank">ramanihuria.org/conference</a>.</p><p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</p><p style="color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: normal;">&nbsp;</p><p><em><font color="#333333" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Bitstream Charter, Times, serif"><span style="font-size: 16px;">"Content CC-BY-SA 4.0.
