<p>Early this year, <a href="http://hot.openstreetmap.org/updates/2013-02-01_mali_activation">HOT was activated in Mali</a>. Pierre Beland took the lead on this activation, and produced for OCHA <a href="http://hot.openstreetmap.org/sites/default/files/HOTOSMMaliActivationMappingfactsreport-2013-03-04.pdf">this excellent report</a>.

The location of villages was micro-tasked through a newly built, custom tool, <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/2012_Mali_Crisis#Experimentation_of_Crowdsourcing_Image_Recognition_-_2013-02">Kuona</a>, which guided more in depth mapping. The team analysed connectivity of villages over roads and the extent of flooding.

As with most HOT activations, the support team centered coordination on the #hot IRC channel, including discussions with humanitarian clusters. Well done!</a></p>
