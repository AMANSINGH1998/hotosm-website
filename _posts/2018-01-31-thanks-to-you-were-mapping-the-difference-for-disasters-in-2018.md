<p>We wanted to take the time to thank each and every one of our individual donors who are helping to #mapthedifference in 2018. Your donations, over our goal of $30,000, will ensure that HOT is ready to respond to disasters. Additionally, it will support Microgrants for up to 5 local OSM communities to&nbsp; grow their mapping community and strengthen their responses, whenever disaster may occur or to aid efforts in rebuilding. Learn more about applying for Microgrants <a href="https://www.hotosm.org/updates/2018-01-17_funds_for_community_led_projects_to_improve_resilience_to_disasters_and_crises" target="_blank">here.</a>&nbsp;A special Thank You to all our Fundraisers and recurring donors for their commitment to HOT's mission.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="/sites/default/files/wordcloud%20%281%29.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768"></p>
