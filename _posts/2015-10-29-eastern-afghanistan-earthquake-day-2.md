<p>Since the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) officially activated on the 27th October, the team has been working hard to evaluate the mapping needs in response to the Eastern Afghanistan earthquake. There are two Tasking Manager projects set up in an effort to map key affected areas:</p><ul><li><a href="http://tasks.hotosm.org/project/1263">#1263</a> - Afganistan EQ Response 2015, Nangarar Province</li><li><a href="http://tasks.hotosm.org/project/1264">#1264</a>&nbsp;- Afghanistan EQ Response 2015, Takhar-Badakhshan Province</li></ul><p>We would like to ask volunteers and community members to focus their efforts on project&nbsp;<a href="http://tasks.hotosm.org/project/1264">#1264</a>&nbsp;and map the road networks and residential areas towards the south. Detailed instructions can be found in the task.</p><p>We would also like to say thank you to those that have been volunteering their time to map, as we have see the efforts double in the last day. The number of OSM contributors went from 129 to 245, while the number of map changes went from 201,779 to 412,357.&nbsp;</p><p>Every edit made is a huge step towards getting the much needed map data to those responding to the disaster. Please see the Eastern Afghanistan Earthquake <a href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/2015_Eastern_Afghanistan_Earthquake">wiki page</a> for more information, as well as the OCHA <a href="http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/ocha_flash_update_badakshan_earthquake_2.pdf">Flash Update</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src="/sites/default/files/OSM%20Changesets-resized.png" alt="" width="1024" height="518"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
