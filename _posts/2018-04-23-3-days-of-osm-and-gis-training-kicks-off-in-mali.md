*Guest blog; Nathalie Sidibe, OSM Mali*

Today marks the kickoff of 3 days of GIS training for OSM Mali! The OSM Mali team are supporting training in collaboration with <a href="https://agetic.gouv.ml/">Agetic</a>, a Public Administration Office that works in the digital sector and advocates ICT in Mali.

Agetic has been collaborating with the OpenStreetMap Mali Community since August 2016, promotingOpenStreetMap, OpenData and GIS in Mali through trainings, mapathons and field data collection. This collaboration began with the advocacy of a mapping project for Digital Innovation organizations in French-Speaking Africa, called CarteInnov. This project was initiated and funded by the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie in 14 countries including Mali, and is managed by local consultants who are supported by Les Libres GÃ©ographes.

Throughout this project, I have had the opportunity to talk about OpenStreetMap and its impact towards sustainable development with staff from private and public offices, Tech-Hubs, as well as Agetic themselves.In June 2017 staff from Agetic participated in 10 days of OpenStreetMap and GIS training organized by the Projet Espace OpenStreetMap Francophone, Les Libres Geographes and OSM Mali in Bamako in collaboration with the Organisation Internationale Francophonie.

In order to strengthen this partnership, OSM Mali members and Agetic staff decided to organize OpenStreetMap and GIS training from the 23rd to 27th April 2018 for students and graduates of Mali who are interested and motivated to learn about these topics.
