<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto;">The "<a href="http://ramanihuria.org/">Dar Ramani Huria</a>" Scale Up Workshop took place at Nkrumah Hall, University of Dar es Salaam, on Monday 6<sup>th</sup> of July. Over the next three months, the Ramani Huria project ‘Community Mapping for Flood Resilience’ will be building on previous work and expanding its mapping activtities to 10-14 additional wards across Dar es Salaam. "Dar Ramani Huria" (Dar Open Map) is the local name of the "Community Mapping for Flood Resilience" project run in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania by HOT.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto;"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/1_1.jpg" alt="" height="379" width="648"></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto;">The scale up will be lead by a group of fifteen students who have been trained by HOT, and previously worked with community members to map Ndugumbi, Tandale, and Mchikichini wards. HOT staff on the project are Paul Uithol (project manager), Geoffrey Kateregga (lead mapping supervisor), Steven Bukulu (mapping supervisor), and Sophie Lafayette (media specialist). In the coming weeks, the project with involve an additional 140 university students from the University of Dar es Salaam (UDSM) and Ardhi University, as well as community members from across the 10 to 14 wards to be mapped.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%;">In the first phase of the scale up, six wards will be mapped, including Makumbusho, Makurumla, Msasani, Mburahati and Mabibo. The wards to be mapped during the project are some of the most densely populated areas of Dar es Salaam and consist mostly of informal settlements. Settlements in these wards are also often built in flood prone areas, leading them to being heavily affected when flooding occurs.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%;"><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/2_0.png" alt="" height="706" width="500"></p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto;">The Scale Up Workshop consisted of two panels and a student participation workshop, with both students and ward officials in attendance.

To further boost the project activities, HOT has acquired two drones for the project from <a href="https://www.sensefly.com/"><font color="#1155cc"><u>senseFLY</u></font></a>, which will help provide high resolution aerial imagery that will make mapping easier and more accurate. Included in the workshop introduction was a short demonstration and overview of the drones. The second part of the workshop allowed the students to experiment with mapping techniques and put their initial training into practice.</p><p><span>Following the Scale Up Workshop, students were given a complete training in mapping tools and techniques (July 7-9</span><span>th</span><span>) , before the commencement of mapping (July 13</span><span>th</span>). The course materials used are available on the project’s <a href="https://github.com/hotosm/RamaniHuria">Github repository</a>.</p><p style="margin-bottom: 0cm; line-height: 115%; page-break-before: auto; page-break-after: auto; padding-left: 90px;"><img class="image-medium" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/styles/medium/public/Community_Mapping_Logo_smaller_0.jpg?itok=At2R7o1r" alt="" height="250" width="237"></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
