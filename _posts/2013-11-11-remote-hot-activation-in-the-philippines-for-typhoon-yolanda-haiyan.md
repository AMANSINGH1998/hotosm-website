<p>The Humanitarian OpenSteetMap Team (HOT) has activated to provide geographic base data in areas affected by typhoon Yolanda/Haiyan in the Philippines. Currently we are supporting the active OpenStreetMap Philippines community and we have activated in conjunction with our partners at the <a href="http://digitalhumanitarians.com/">Digital Humanitarian Network(DHN)</a>. For more information about what other DHN partners are doing please <a href="http://digitalhumanitarians.com/profiles/blogs/yolanda">read their blog post about the activation</a>. We are also working closely with <a href="http://www.unocha.org/">United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs</a> (UNOCHA) and the <a href="http://www.redcross.org/what-we-do/international-services">American Red Cross</a> (ARC) to determine if they have mapping needs which we can help fulfill.</p><h2>Resources</h2><p>Here are OpenStreetMap related resources that may be useful to responders.</p><ul><li><a href="http://www.s1expeditions.com/p/openstreetmaps.html">Daily updated routable Garmin maps for your GPS.</a></li><li><a href="http://fieldpapers.org/">Field Papers</a> allow you to print atlases easily using OpenStreetMap data as a base.</li><li><a href="http://labs.geofabrik.de/haiyan/">Extracts of raw OpenStreetMap data in a variety of GIS formats</a> from Geofabrik</li>[Update: Geofabrik set up this new downloads location specifically for this disaster.
