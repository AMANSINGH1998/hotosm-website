Summary Text: Malaria is a disease that affects millions of people around the world,
  particularly children under 5 and women. Malaria is prevalent in some of the most
  unmapped places. Malaria is a preventable and curable disease, but currently organisations
  do not have detailed data on the number of vulnerable people in an area, which reduces
  their ability to respond. Malaria spreads through mosquito bites, and if you can
  prevent bites, you can reduce the spread of infection. This means that you need
  to know where those vulnerable to malaria live, so you can spray their homes with
  insecticide or distribute bednets. This way you can save more lives, more quickly.
