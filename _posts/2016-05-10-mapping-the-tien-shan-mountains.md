The paper maps were already highly detailed and accurate. Data collection in the field added even more specific and geo-located information. Working on the computers brought in a new dimension, as most participants had little experience using modern technologies, and frequent power cuts and challenging internet connectivity added additional hurdles. But the high motivation and perseverance showed that it was worth the effort and everyone was enjoying the work.<br><img class="image-large" style="margin: 10px;" src="/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/kyrgyz11.jpg?itok=97-X9gSB" alt="" width="480" height="318"><br>In cooperation with teachers and students, 10 accurate, versatile, up to date and reusable village maps were created (see a before and after examples below).
