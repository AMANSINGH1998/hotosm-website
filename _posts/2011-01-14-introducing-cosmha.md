<p id="_mcePaste">A new organization has been formed to sustain, support, and grow the local OpenStreetMap Community&nbsp;in Haiti. &nbsp;COSMHA, or Comunite OpenStreetMap de Haiti, was formed in late 2010 by a group of mappers&nbsp;from Port au Prince with the goal of ensuring that the best map data for Haiti is created by Haitians&nbsp;and available to anyone to use and improve.</p><p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/imagec-osm.ha_.jpg" alt="">COSMHA Workshop at IOM offices in Gonaives</p><p>COSMHA now has over 200 members, primarily from Port au Prince, but active groups are working in several&nbsp;other communities including Leogane, Jacmel, and Gonaives. &nbsp;The group came into existence in the months&nbsp;following the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti as a result of a partnership between the Community Forum&nbsp;of Cite Soleil and the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT).</p><p id="_mcePaste">OpenStreetMap was widely used by humanitarian agencies during search and rescue efforts and response planning&nbsp;in the days and weeks following the earthquake. &nbsp;Following the initial emergency, the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap&nbsp;Team began work to ensure that the rich and detailed data in OSM for Haiti would continue to be sustained and improved&nbsp;by the local community. &nbsp;With the support of the International Organization of Migration (IOM), COSMHA is out in the&nbsp;field daily, mapping communities and providing data critical to the ongoing relief efforts.</p><p id="_mcePaste">COSMHA's current work centers around creating maps that will assist the cholera response. &nbsp;Teams have been&nbsp;active around the country, collecting data on cholera treatment facilities and water and sanitation infrastructure.&nbsp;Mappers ride motorbikes, walk, and take tap taps to reach remote areas. &nbsp;In the next six months, COSMHA hopes to expand&nbsp;it's activities and membership to include the majority of the country.</p>
