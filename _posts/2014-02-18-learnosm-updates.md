<p class="p1">Recently we've made some improvements to <a href="http://learnosm.org/en/" target="_blank">LearnOSM</a>, HOT's resource for learning to use OpenStreetMap from the ground up.&nbsp; It's not always easy keeping up with a resource like this.&nbsp; OSM is constantly changing and so are the tools which we aim to teach.&nbsp; With seven translations (and counting), updates to LearnOSM must be coordinated among a diverse group of content creators and translators.&nbsp; Fortunately, the support for this process is immense.</p><h2 class="p1">Updates</h2><p class="p1">We have updated the LearnOSM tutorials to reflect various software changes that have occurred in the past years.&nbsp; The Beginner Guide now contains more detailed explanations of editing with JOSM, using Field Papers, and getting started with the iD editor.&nbsp; In addition, we have added three new guides for continued learning - <a href="http://learnosm.org/en/editing/" target="_blank">Detailed Editing</a> contains many tutorials which cover advanced topics in JOSM.&nbsp; There is also a full length chapter on using the iD editor.&nbsp; Other guides cover topics related to <a href="http://learnosm.org/en/osm-data/" target="_blank">OSM data</a> and <a href="http://learnosm.org/en/map-design/" target="_blank">Map Design</a>.</p><p class="p1"><img class="image-large" title="New Chapters on LearnOSM" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/styles/large/public/new_learn_osm.png?itok=ulgHXhHL" alt="New Chapters on LearnOSM" height="349" width="510"></p><h2 class="p1">Translations</h2><p class="p1">Current translations include Indonesian, Japanese, Portuguese, Italian, French, German, and Spanish.&nbsp; The Japanese translation has the honor of being the first to incorporate all the updates (<a href="http://learnosm.org/jp/" target="_blank">awesome work Satoshi!</a>).&nbsp; We expect other translations to catch up soon.&nbsp; In addition, new teams have formed to translate the guides into Croatian, Romanian, and Galician, which will bring LearnOSM up to ten translations.&nbsp; This is fantastic, as the more content we develop and the more translations we have, the wider an audience LearnOSM will be able to reach.&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">&nbsp;</p><p class="p1">A big thanks to everyone who provides content and translations.&nbsp; And remember if you'd like to contribute, all the work is done over on <a href="https://github.com/hotosm/learnosm" target="_blank">Github</a>.</p>
