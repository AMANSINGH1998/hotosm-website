Summary Text: "Rapid growth and low elevation makes flooding in Jakarta problematic.
  Innovative approaches are needed for contingency planning and impact modeling. Â DKI
  Jakarta's Disaster Management Agency (BPBD) is developing a detailed scenario to
  estimate impacts of future flooding. This scenario will estimate the impact on people,
  schools, hospitals, and other important buildings. Such a scenario will become a
  powerful tool for local government and other stakeholders to take action to be better
  prepared for future floods. This first step in this type of analysis is having available
  data, without data it is impossible to make an accurate estimation. Throughout March
  mapping events will be held in DKI Jakarta to work with local leaders to collect
  such data, by utilizing OpenStreetMap."

<p>Rapid growth and low elevation makes flooding in Jakarta problematic. Innovative approaches are needed for contingency planning and impact modeling. &nbsp;DKI Jakarta's Disaster Management Agency (BPBD) is developing a detailed scenario to estimate impacts of future flooding. This scenario will estimate the impact on people, schools, hospitals, and other important buildings. Such a scenario will become a powerful tool for local government and other stakeholders to take action to be better prepared for future floods. This first step in this type of analysis is having available data, without data it is impossible to make an accurate estimation. Throughout March mapping events will be held in DKI Jakarta to work with local leaders to collect such data, by utilizing OpenStreetMap.<!--break--></p><h2>Organizers and Assistance</h2><p>The Regional Disaster Management Agency (BPBD DKI Jakarta) and <a href="http://www.bnpb.go.id/website/asp/index.asp">Indonesia's National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB)</a> are leading this mapping initiative. In support roles are AusAID through the <a href="http://aifdr.org">Australia-Indonesia Facility for Disaster Reduction (AIFDR)</a>, the <a href="http://ochaonline.un.org/Default.aspx?alias=ochaonline.un.org/indonesia">United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA)</a>, and <a href="http://gfdrr.org/gfdrr/labs">Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery Labs (GFDRR)</a>. Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) members Kate Chapman, Emir Hartato and Vasanthi are leading the mapping support with assistance from the <a href="http://www.ui.ac.id/en">University of Indonesia</a>(UI)&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.airputih.or.id/">Air Putih</a>.</p><h2>The Process</h2><p>Next week training of University of Indonesia students will begin, so they can help facilitate the mapping workshops. &nbsp;After a one day training in OpenStreetMap for data collection and QGIS for map printing there will be a preparation day to create maps for the mapping events.&nbsp;Five workshops will be held over the course of two weeks, one in each region of Jakarta. The head of each Kelurahan(village) will be invited to come map critical infrastructure. Prior to the workshop the Kelurahan heads will receive a packet with paper maps to draw schools, government facilities and boundaries ahead of time. That way when the workshop begins there will be data to enter.</p><p>The workshops will have two components to them. In the morning more information about community mapping and how it can inform decision makers for disaster preparedness planning and in cases of response. The second component will be actual mapping. &nbsp;Students from UI will be paired up with a Kelurahan head to assist them in mapping their area in OpenStreetMap. This will serve to confirm administrative boundaries as well as important buildings and roads.</p><p>The types of buildings that will be mapped are:</p><ul><li>Government Offices</li><li>Fire Stations</li><li>Police Stations</li><li>Schools</li><li>Sports Facilities</li><li>Health Facilities</li><li>Religious Facilities</li></ul><p>Following the workshops there will be data verification days where students will make sure the data is entered correctly and travel to verify information if necessary.</p><h2>Expected Results</h2><p>This month of mapping will serve to create a base dataset for Jakarta. &nbsp;This dataset will be used to print maps for each of the communities and can also be fed into Risk in a Box (impact modeling software) to determine effects of flooding in Jakarta. Additionally mapping Jakarta will serve to inform future mapping events in the rest of Indonesia. &nbsp;If this is successful other regional disaster management agencies can utilize the techniques to improve their preparedness data as well.</p><p>Additionally the hope is the communities being mapped will see the possibility of having this information available. Each Kelurahan head will now know where to get further information on OpenStreetMap if they wish to take the mapping even further.</p><h2>Keep Informed of the Process</h2><p>To follow the progress check back here, follow <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/search/%23petajakarta">#petajakarta</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://facebook.com/hotosm">HOT on Facebook</a>.</p><h2>New Materials</h2><p>We were so excited about this event that <a href="http://whateverisaid.wordpress.com/">Emir Hartato</a> designed OpenStreetMap Indonesia stickers and we have a new flyer about OpenStreetMap in both English and Bahasa Indonesia.</p><p><img class="image-large" title="OSM ID Sticker" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hotwww/files/old/styles/large/public/osm_id_sticker_0.png?itok=6z_ffTSP" alt="" height="510" width="395"></p><p>Translation: Free Map for Everyone</p>
