Anyone can get involved in HOT activities, and we have a wonderful community of people from across the globe who choose to do so by helping with remote mapping initiatives and also things like technical development work and community building in the field. You can all regard yourselves as part of the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team; all we ask is that you uphold the HOT Community Code of Conduct. Additionally, our Members are guided by the HOT Membership Code.

We have one "class of members" as defined in our Articles of Incorporation. These Voting Members are those in the HOT community who have shown commitment to the HOT mission and are responsible for voting "on matters affecting the Corporation including, but not limited to, the election of directors and [additional] voting members." Nominations for membership take place periodically; not a constant rolling program (typically once or twice a year).  We think of these people as our select "core team".
