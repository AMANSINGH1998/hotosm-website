Anyone can get involved in HOT activities, and we have a wonderful community of people from across the globe who choose to do so by helping in a variety of tasks. Examples include remote mapping initiatives and also things like technical development work and community building in the field.

You can all regard yourselves as part of the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team; all we ask is that you uphold the HOT Community Code of Conduct.

We think of Voting Members as our select "core team", who are guided by the HOT Membership Code. The Voting Members are people in the HOT community who have shown commitment to the HOT mission. Voting Members are responsible for voting "on matters affecting the Corporation including, but not limited to, the election of directors and [additional] voting members." Nominations for membership take place periodically; not a constant rolling program (typically once or twice a year).
