## Get in touch and talk to us
Join the conversation on [Slack](http://slack.hotosm.org/)! A large number of volunteer and staff discuss mapping, emergencies, working groups and other matters on our Slack channel.

## Mapping Volunteers

As a mapping volunteer, you can get involved with projects around the world by using your time to remotely map. Even if you are a new mapper, anyone who can use a computer to draw lines and boxes or use a phone to swipe and tap can meaningfully contribute to humanitarian mapping through OpenStreetMap. If you have never mapped before and would like to help, visit the Tasking Manager's [Learn page](https://tasks.hotosm.org/learn) to get started mapping in less than 30 minutes.
