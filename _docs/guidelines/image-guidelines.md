## General Guidelines

Image Size:

Image Quality:
  - well-framed
  - in-focus
  - tweak colors, contrast if needed

## Project pages and blog posts

Recommended width: 1600px or 1440px

All images are centered on the page. If you have an image that isn't perfectly framed or needs to be aligned in a different way, you can use the metadata flag, `Is image top aligned`:
