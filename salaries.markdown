title: HOT Salary Framework
date: 2019-03-29 20:14:00 Z
Intro Text: HOT began to roll out our new salary framework in January 2019. The framework
  is a simple, global standard that we use to determine salaries and wages at HOT,
  and applies to all HOT employees in all locations. The framework is also used to
  negotiate rates for individual contractors working with HOT. With this framework,
  HOT aims to provide more transparency into the salary decision making process and
  ensure equitable outcomes for all staff, regardless of position, location, gender,
  or any other distinguishing characteristic.

# The HOT Salary Framework

## Role Base
Each staff member is assigned a standard role based on duties, level of responsibility, and years of experience. All roles are benchmarked against US average pay for that position using Glassdoor.com with an organization size of 0-50 employees (no location specified). This is the organization size that best aligns with HOT's annual revenue. A similar or "best fit" title is used if there is insufficient data for HOTâ€™s exact title.

Next, a "Nonprofit Multiplier" of 90% is applied. We are driven by mission - not profit - but still want to compensate staff well, within our means. For us, this means paying 90% of market average salary for organizations of our size.
