Intro Text: HOT began to roll out our new salary framework in January 2019. The framework
  is a simple, global standard that we use to determine salaries and wages at HOT,
  and applies to all HOT employees in all locations. The framework is also used to
  negotiate rates for individual contractors working with HOT.

# The HOT Salary Framework

## Role Base
* All roles benchmarked against US average pay for that position (Glassdoor.com).
* Used organization size of 0-50 employees with no location specified. This is the organization size that best aligns with HOT's annual revenue.
* Used a similar/“best fit” title if insufficient data for HOT’s exact title.
* Nonprofit Multiplier: We are driven by mission - not profit - but still want to compensate staff well, within our means. For us, this means paying 90% of market average salary for organizations of our size.
