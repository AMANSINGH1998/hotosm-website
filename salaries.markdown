title: HOT Salary Framework
date: 2019-03-29 20:14:00 Z
Intro Text: HOT began to roll out our new salary framework in January 2019. The framework
  is a simple, global standard that we use to determine salaries and wages at HOT,
  and applies to all HOT employees in all locations. The framework is also used to
  negotiate rates for individual contractors working with HOT. With this framework,
  HOT aims to provide more transparency into the salary decision making process and
  ensure equitable outcomes for all staff, regardless of position, location, gender,
  or any other distinguishing characteristic.

# The HOT Salary Framework

## Role Base

Each staff member is assigned a standard role based on duties, level of responsibility, and years of experience. All roles are benchmarked against US average pay for that position using Glassdoor.com with an organization size of 0-50 employees (no location specified). This is the organization size that best aligns with HOT's annual revenue. A similar or "best fit" title is used if there is not enough data points on Glassdoor.com for HOTâ€™s exact title.

Next, a "Nonprofit Multiplier" of 90% is applied. We are driven by mission - not profit - but still want to compensate staff well, within our means. For us, this means paying 90% of market average salary for organizations of our size.

## Location Factor
HOT work locations are grouped into several bands according to two inputs:
1. Cost of living (compared to Washington, DC, US) Source: Numbeo.com
2: Average salary (in your country compared to the US) Sources: ILO, OECD, Gallup

Bands range from 0.20 to 1.0. HOT's base band is 1.0 for US-based staff based on a Washington, D.C. benchmark.

### Staff deployed on mission with HOT outside of their home country for long periods of time (over one month)
Staff deployed from lower cost of living locations receive a "bump up" to the 0.50 band to recognize hardship in being away from home. Staff deployed from higher cost of living locations continue to be paid based on their home band in recognition of costs that they continue to bear in their home country such as housing, retirement savings, student loan or housing debt, etc.)

Digital Nomads
The HOT Framework also accounts for "Digital Nomads": Those staff with a permanent address in 1.00 or 0.90 bands but who choose to live/work in a lower cost of living country. HOT's "Digital Nomad" rate is 0.80, which gives staff on the global team the flexibility to live and work where they choose while sharing cost savings between the staff member and HOT.
