When disaster strikes, HOT mobilizes our global network of thousands of volunteers who work together to map the impacted area in OpenStreetMap. We don't only do it after disaster: every day, HOT volunteers work tirelessly to put the most vulnerable people and places on the map before disaster strikes. These maps contribute to saving lives in emergency.

Mapping vulnerable places in the world takes a global community. HOT is your community, your map, and is supported by your generosity.
