Sri Lanka's geographical environment and geomorphic and climatic conditions make it vulnerable to various types of natural disasters such as floods, landslides, cyclones, droughts, gales, coastal erosion and tsunamis very frequently. Currently, local maps are not sufficient to create detailed emergency management plans as well as mitigation plans to reduce the loss of properties and life. The OSM Sri Lanka team together with OSGeo Sri Lanka Chapter are working hard to build detailed maps across the country to help emergency responders and planners in the future.
