The Ger Community Map Center has managed to convert the Emergency Department to be based on OpenStreetMap data to provide people with updated information on areas where forest fires, dzuds (severe winters) and floods are prevalent. Previously, Emergency Department staff did not have reliable maps to navigate the fastest accessible route to reach areas in need of help during nautral disasters and the spread of animal diseases. The new maps produced will support effective disaster relief in the future.
