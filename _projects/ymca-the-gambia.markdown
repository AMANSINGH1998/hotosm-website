After 22 years of imposed governmental internet restrictions, YMCA Gambia are leading the way in open data by working with young people to map social services such as hospitals, street names, water points, and key community assets. Heavy bi-annual rains and the flat topography of the country means that flooding is an ongoing risk for inhabitants. The maps produced by the Gambia OSM community will help inform flood disaster relief plans and response.
