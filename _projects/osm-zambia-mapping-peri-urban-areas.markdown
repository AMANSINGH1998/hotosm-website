Since 2016, OSM Zambia has been introducing communities to OSM and tools used in mapping and data collection. The objective is for local people to be able to map peri-urban areas which are facing challenges like flooding, cholera and poor delivery of services, including Water and Sanitation. 

So far, the OSM Zambia community have mapped Lusaka, the Capital City of Zambia, Misisi, Chaisa, Emmasdale, as well as mapping of Kawama settlement in Mufulira in the copper-belt province of Zambia. OSM Zambia has gone further to conduct a socio-economic survey in Kawama settlement. Over 70,000 buildings have been mapped. The open geospatial data created is being freely-accessed by the Ministry of Local Government and various local authorities that are using OSM data for town planning and development initiatives.
