Initiated by the Bangladesh HumanitarianOpenStreetMap Operation Team (BHOOT) in collaboration with Pathao Ltd, one of the major ride sharing service providers in Bangladesh besides Uber, the Map Your City initiative aims to map all major cities in Bangladesh. So far, the initiative has mapped across Dhaka to Chittagong, Sylhet, Khulna, Rajshahi, Comilla, Mymensingh and Jessore. These maps will contribute to sustainable urban development initiatives.
