The escalation of violence and deteriorating economic conditions in Venezuela have led to a large outflow of Venezuelans into Aruba and other Southern Caribbean countries. The influx received is characterized by increasingly complex mixed population movements that involves asylum-seekers, migrants, refugees, victims of human trafficking, smuggling, along with other categories of vulnerable persons of concerns. As the crisis in Venezuela worsens, the number of asylum applications by citizens of that country has soared. However, these figures represent only a fraction of the total number of Venezuelans who may be in need of international protection, as many do not or cannot register as asylum seekers.

HOT is providing assistance to UNHCR in their efforts to understand the conditions, population, and needs of Venezuelans in Aruba. This project will enhance UNHCRâ€™s ability to offer targeted and principled assistance to the most vulnerable and those in need of protection across the island.
