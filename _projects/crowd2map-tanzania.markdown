Crowd2Map has been mapping Tanzania since 2015 and has over 7500 online volunteers and local partners across 26 rural areas. Their 'Community Change Agents', local village based volunteers, are adding local detail to the base maps using Maps.Me and printed fieldpapers to help protect girls from FGM prevention, and to aid community development.

Crowd2Map have been focusing in particular on the Mara and Simiyu regions where girls are at risk of FGM, as well as adding school and clinic locations to OpenStreetMap nationwide. Their mission is to map all of rural Tanzania, particularly to enable better planning for delivery of the SDGs in rural areas and to empower disadvantaged communities to put themselves on the map. These maps are used by community activists to locate and protect girls at risk of FGM, as well as providing local officials data needed to plan for the development of services. Despite the illegality of the practice, FGM is still prevalent across many areas of rural Tanzania. A 2016 report from UNICEF show that, alarmingly, in five regions of Tanzania, between 51-80% of girls are still victims of FGM. These statistics often correspond with high rates of child marriage, 2 out of 5 girls are married before the age of 18 in the Mara region of Tanzania, since FGM is seen as a rite of passage in many traditional cultures. These regions are often unmapped, with inconsistent or unknown village names, and unidentifiable features, which makes navigation extremely difficult. By training community members to map building usage, roads, and specific village names, activists have the information needed to improve their programmes. The Mugumu Safe House for girls is one such programme which utilises these open source maps to follow up on local reports and locates girls at risk of FGM. The girls are then taken to the Safe House, where they are provided with shelter, support and health education during the ‘cutting season’.
