Crowd2Map Tanzania is a crowdsourced mapping project aiming to put rural Tanzania on the map, particularly those areas where girls are at risk of FGM. Since 2015, they have been adding schools, hospitals, roads, buildings and villages to OpenStreetMap, an open source map available to all, with the help of over 7500 volunteers worldwide and 600 on the ground in Tanzania.  With only a small Microgrant from HOT and no staff we have so far added over 2.9 million buildings and trained community mappers in 26 areas of Tanzania.  We have also been featured on Al Jazeera, The Guardian HOT, and Missing Maps. Their 'Community Change Agents', local village based volunteers, are adding local detail to the base maps using Maps.Me and printed fieldpapers to help protect girls from FGM prevention, and to aid community development.
 
Having better maps helps FGM activists like Rhobi Samwelly find the villages where girls are at risk of being cut as outlined in this short film.  We are also working with Ushahidi to set up an FGM reporting system in time for the next cutting season in November. Crowd2Map have been focusing in particular on the Mara and Simiyu regions where girls are at risk of FGM, as well as adding school and clinic locations to OpenStreetMap nationwide. Their mission is to map all of rural Tanzania, particularly to enable better planning for delivery of the SDGs in rural areas and to empower disadvantaged communities to put themselves on the map. These maps are used by community activists to locate and protect girls at risk of FGM, as well as providing local officials data needed to plan for the development of services. Despite the illegality of the practice, FGM is still prevalent across many areas of rural Tanzania. A 2016 report from UNICEF show that, alarmingly, in five regions of Tanzania, between 51-80% of girls are still victims of FGM. These statistics often correspond with high rates of child marriage, 2 out of 5 girls are married before the age of 18 in the Mara region of Tanzania, since FGM is seen as a rite of passage in many traditional cultures. These regions are often unmapped, with inconsistent or unknown village names, and unidentifiable features, which makes navigation extremely difficult. By training community members to map building usage, roads, and specific village names, activists have the information needed to improve their programmes. The Mugumu Safe House for girls is one such programme which utilises these open source maps to follow up on local reports and locates girls at risk of FGM. The girls are then taken to the Safe House, where they are provided with shelter, support and health education during the ‘cutting season’.

In addition, Crowd2Map are working with community members to pinpoint and map community painpoints. This includes mapping health facilities to improve emergency response and local health service provision in collaboration with local Red Cross societies. Volunteers have also been working to map access to education by collecting data on school facilities, staffing, resources and students. 

The mapping is in two phases – firstly online volunteers trace roads and buildings from satellite images such as in these tasks then volunteers on the ground add names of villages, offices, churches, shops and other points of interest using a free smartphone app Maps.Me and printed fieldpapers which they email to a remote volunteer helper to input into OSM, and then produce printable maps of villages, wards etc.  Crowd2Map also helped organise the first State of the Map Tanzania, a 3 day mapping training event in Dar es Salaam in December 2017, and a 3 day training event in Mwanza for Open Data Day in March 2018.
 
Many communities in rural Tanzania have various challenges: poverty, food shortages, and poor access to electricity and water, and gender inequality.  Having local access to better maps can help overcome many of them and a solvable problem. There is a 2 min film here showing why.
