Crowd2Map has been mapping Tanzania since 2015 and has over 7500 online volunteers and local partners across 26 rural areas. Their 'Community Change Agents', local village based volunteers, are adding local detail to the base maps using Maps.Me and printed fieldpapers to help protect girls from FGM prevention, and to aid community development.

Crowd2Map have been focusing in particular on the Mara and Simiyu regions where girls are at risk of FGM, as well as adding school and clinic locations to OpenStreetMap nationwide. Their mission is to map all of rural Tanzania, particularly to enable better planning for delivery of the SDGs in rural areas and to empower disadvantaged communities to put themselves on the map.
