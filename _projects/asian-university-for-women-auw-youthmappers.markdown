The Asian University for Women (AUW) YouthMappers team in Bangladesh is the first all women's chapter in the world. AUW have been gathering field data from deep tube-wells in Barayadala, Sitakunda where arsenic contamination has been uncovered. The data they have collected on arsenic-contaminated wells can now be visualized on maps to help the government and NGOs locate affected areas to improve the provision of safe drinking water for people living in affected communities.
