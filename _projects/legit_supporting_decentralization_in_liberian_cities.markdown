Local Empowerment for Government Inclusion and Transparency (LEGIT)
The Liberia Local Empowerment for Government Inclusion and Transparency (LEGIT) project supports to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Governance Commission as they lead, monitor and coordinate the implementation of the government’s decentralization agenda.

HOT will, in close coordination with the LEGIT project team, contribute to several areas of the project, working with the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA)’s Department of Urban Affairs, city administrations in the cities of Gbarnga, Ganta and Zwedru, and selected CSOs and CBOs. HOT’s project objectives within LEGIT are to map administrative boundaries and service delivery infrastructure or points, support our Liberian partners to conduct mapping, develop a service delivery database and to support the development of urban resilience strategies for each city.
