OSM Mali are currently concentrating on three main projects, Mapping Bamako City, Health Sites Mapping, and Mapping Rural Mali. The objective of Mapping Bamako City is to improve the base map of Bamako to inform development initiatives. The project is over 65% completed. OSM Mali have also been facilitating training sessions in collaboration with Agetic, a Public Administration Office that works in the digital sector and advocates ICT in Mali to support students and graduates to become involved in the technology sector. 
The Health Sites Mapping project aims to collect data points of health facilities across Bamako, and eventually extending to all of Mali, in order to build an up-to-date database of health services. OSM Mali are also currently expanding their mapping efforts into rural parts of the country to provide data on public services to encourage development in these areas.
