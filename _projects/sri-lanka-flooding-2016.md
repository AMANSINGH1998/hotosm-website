<pre>Sri Lanka has been hit in the past few days by flooding:

HOT has been asked to activate and immediately start tracing buildings
by the Disaster Management Center (DMC) of Sri Lanka, who work closely
with World Bank GFDRR. They are in urgent need of detailed housing
unit information.

There are links on the HOT Tasking Manager:
<a href="http://tasks.hotosm.org/">http://tasks.hotosm.org/</a>
<br>
This is the earliest phase of response so we are actively working to
find other actors on the ground that the HOT Community can collect and
provide geo data for. This means that you should check the front page
of the tasking manager often, different jobs to support different
ground activities might be coming up.
<br>
HOT members Robert Banick and Mikel Maron will be leading HOT's
response to this crisis. They can be contacted at:
