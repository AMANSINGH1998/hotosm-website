Geochicas are an international women’s mapping community with members in more than 12 different countries. Their aim is for women to have a greater presence and participation in key OSM events, increase female participation and leadership, and generate mapping projects which benefit women. Their main focus as a group is to help close the gender gap in the OSM community, not only in terms of participation, but also in data creation and curation.

The Geochicas team are currently starting a pilot project about informal shelters and its relation to women’s security after a disaster. The project is based in the Oaxaca region which has suffered two major earthquakes in the last year. Collaborating with disaster response experts, the aim is to create a database of informal provisional shelters and designated shelters to overlay with the geographical locations of reports of sexual harassment and gender violence. The maps produced will help inform and improve women's safety in the area and during future disaster management.
