The Geochicas team are currently starting a pilot project about informal shelters and its relation to womenâ€™s security after a disaster. The project is based in the Oaxaca region which has suffered two major earthquakes in the last year. Collaborating with disaster response experts, the aim is to create a database of informal provisional shelters and designated shelters to overlay with the geographical locations of reports of sexual harassment and gender violence. The maps produced will help inform and improve women's safety in the area and during future disaster management.
