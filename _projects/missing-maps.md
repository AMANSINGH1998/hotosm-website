<p>The Missing Maps is a collaborative project powered by HOT, MSF, and the British / American Red Cross.</p><p>The aim is to provide base maps in the most vulnerable places in the developing world, in order that international and local NGOs and individuals can use the maps and data to better respond to crises affecting those areas, especially when those crises don't make the headlines.&nbsp;</p><p>The data we create is used by NGOs to implement spatial epidemiology that improves response to outbreaks of diseases such as cholera, ebola and measles. It is also used to carry out disaster risk reduction programmes.<span class="file">&nbsp;<a title="Missing Maps logo" href="/sites/default/files/Missing-Maps-logo.jpg"><br></a></span></p><p>Project ethics</p><ul><li>Using OpenStreetMap ensures that all data gathered under the project banner will be free, open, and available for use under OpenStreetMap’s open license.</li><li>All 'in country' activities, i.e. local mapping and data collection, will be carried out in collaboration with local people and in a respectful manner at all times.</li><li>When working locally, people come before the data. Meaning if the goal is to map a city there needs to be a plan in place to ensure access to technology and training for those living in that community to continue using the maps after project completion.</li><li>Members of Missing Maps actively contribute to Missing Map's objectives, the OpenStreetMap repository and benefitting communities, both local and international.</li><li>Missing Maps activities emphasize building, and leaving behind, local capacity and access. We are cautious about rapid data collection without significant local participation, and always make efforts to ensure local access.</li><li>Missing Maps activities are designed to be accessible and open for participation for individuals who want to contribute towards the project objectives.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;<span class="file"><img class="file-icon" title="image/jpeg" src="/modules/file/icons/image-x-generic.png" alt=""> <a title="Missing Maps logo" href="/sites/default/files/Missing-Maps-logo.jpg">Missing Maps logo</a></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
