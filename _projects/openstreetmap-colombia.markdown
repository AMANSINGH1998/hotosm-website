In Colombia, Fundaci√≥n OpenStreetMap Colombia are collaborating on the Countryside Mappers program to empower people, associations, and communities for territorial management, particularly within times of crisis. Recently, agricultural communities have suffered from devastating earthquakes as well as landslides during rainy seasons. The updated data collected will be used to create Territorial Arrangement Planning maps.
