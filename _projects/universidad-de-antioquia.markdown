Universidad de Antioquia have been mapping fishermen villages across 190km of coastline in rural areas near the Turbo River floodplain. The main goal of COASTMAP-URAB√Å is to map fishing communities, particularly those affected by flooding due to climate change. In addition, the team have mapped mangroves and freshwater wetlands within the area which act as nursery areas, fishing grounds, and natural coastal flooding barriers. So far over 25,256 OSM edits have been made.
