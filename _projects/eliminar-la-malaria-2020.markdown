Although Guatemala has made great progress in reducing its Malaria burden in recent decades, the national program aims to scale up program capacity to address the ongoing threat of Malaria. National surveillance data from Guatemala suggest that malaria transmission is highly concentrated in certain regions of the country. In 2015, 5,437 confirmed cases were reported, with approximately 66% in the department of Escuintla. Escuintla is heavily characterized by agriculture including large-scale sugar, banana and palm oil plantations. 

In partnership with the Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI), HOT is performing an on-the-ground validation exercise across eight localities in Escuintla and providing support for the integration of OpenMapKit (OMK) and other mobile data collection tools into vector control operations. The data collected will be used to monitor progress and completion of vector control campaigns, help the malaria program to better understand settlement patterns, estimate the number of households in a village, target interventions, and better plan for vector control operations on the ground.
