OSM Guinea have been mapping health facilities in Conakry as part of their project 'Cartographie des structures privées de santé de la ville de Conakry'. The data collected highlights private health services in the city which will be used to improve access to health facilities. This mapping will also help strengthen the governance of the private health sector.
