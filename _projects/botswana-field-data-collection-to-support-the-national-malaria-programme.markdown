Current data on OSM in Botswana include polygons (outlines) of all buildings identified via satellite imagery, but no additional information about the type of buildings mapped, or of household size are included, nor information on the general accuracy, validity, and completeness of remotely mapped data. In order to improve the usefulness of the OSM data in malaria elimination programmes. This is to support Indoor Residual Spraying campaigns, provide better data for further types of interventions, and allow better monitoring and the measurement of effects.
