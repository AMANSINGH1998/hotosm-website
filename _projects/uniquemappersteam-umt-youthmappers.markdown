Communities based in the Rivers State, Nigeria are vulnerable to oil spill disasters,flooding and malaria. The main focus of the UniqueMappersTeam YouthMappers is to make geographic data readily available to researchers, the private sector, government agencies, relief agencies and all stakeholders in Nigeria to respond rapidly to vulnerable communities and crises in the region. In particular, the team are gathering field data to put vulnerable communities and areas on the map to ensure a spatially-based mitigation and response plan. The UMT are also working hard to improve female participation in the sector through their branch of LetGirlsMap. They are also working to establish and train humanitarian YouthMappers teams in Nigerian Universities for effective disaster rapid response. UMT map remotely and locally to create databases easily accessible to agencies for quick and proactive response to disasters.Their immediate mapping community includes Port Harcourt, Rivers State, the Niger Delta region and Nigeria.
