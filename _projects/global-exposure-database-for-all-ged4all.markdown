HOT has partnered with the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) and ImageCat on a Challenge Fund focused on developing a global exposure database for multi-hazard risk analysis. The Challenge Fund, formed by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) and the UK’s Department for International Development (DFID) is aimed at building local and global resilience through innovation in order to better identify risk and enable more effective decision-making.

This is the second round of the Challenge Fund, which focuses on three pilot projects that address the recommendations made in the recent GFDRR report ‘Solving the Puzzle: Innovating to Reduce Risk’ - namely, to expand the effort to decrease disaster risk management costs and increase resilience by developing a framework that facilitates a multi-hazard view of risk. Based on this research, efforts are being focused on developing the first set of open and internally consistent data on hazards, exposure, and vulnerability.

Challenge 1, is led by the British Geological Survey (BGS) and focuses on developing a data schema and data for a multi-hazard database. Challenge 2, is led by GEM and focuses on developing a data schema and data for a global exposure database, whom HOT is partner with. Challenger 3, is led by University College of London (UCL) and focuses on developing a data schema and data for a global database of vulnerability functions.

The development of the open global exposure database aims to store different assets including, infrastructure, land-use, and socio-economic data. These assets will be relevant for multiple natural hazards, including earthquakes, floods, volcanoes, strong winds, tsunamis and drought. 

HOT partnered with GEM, who led the project and ImageCat, on the development of a ‘Global Exposure Database for Multi-Hazard Risk Analysis’. The collaboration resulted in an open exposure database (GED4ALL) schema for multi-hazard risk analysis, along with protocols to integrate existing datasets, as well as generate new exposure information. 

An online tool following the database schemas developed as part of the Challenge Fund is currently in the pipeline by GFDRR to host the GED4ALL data, along with the hazard footprints and vulnerability models. The data itself is slowly being populated globally through various projects, such as the [Open Cities Africa](https://www.hotosm.org/updates/open-cities-africa-kicks-off-in-kampala/) initiative lead by GFDRR and the [METEOR](https://www.hotosm.org/projects/modelling-exposure-through-earth-observation-meteor/) project lead by the British Geological Survey (BGS).

HOT provided guidance on how GED4ALL can be populated with building level data from OpenStreetMap (OSM), assigning the most commonly used tags for the attributes identified by GEM as integral to determining the structural integrity of infrastructure in the wake of a hazard. The hazards taken into account while developing the taxonomy include earthquakes, volcanoes, floods, tsunamis, storms, cyclones and drought. The following OSM wiki pages proposes and welcomes contributions from the community on how tags can be best aligned with the GED4ALL taxonomy:

Although the three Challenge Funds are being developed somewhat independently, it is crucial to ensure their compatibility. For example, the spatial resolution between the exposure and the hazard must be compatible, as well as the taxonomy employed for the classification of the exposed elements and respective vulnerability functions. All three databases will be tested with data for the country of Tanzania.
