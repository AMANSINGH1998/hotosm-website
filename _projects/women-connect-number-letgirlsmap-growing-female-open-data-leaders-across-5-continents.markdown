Project Summary Text: |
  Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) was selected from more than 500 applications as a winner of the USAID Women Connect Challenge. The Women Connect Challenge aims to bridge the digital gender divide and increase womenâ€™s access and usage of technology to improve their everyday lives.

  As part of the Women Connect Challenge, HOT is supporting three communities to create gendered data about gendered problems that affect them, and working with YouthMappers to engage more young people in this mission. Our goal is to create spaces where women are **explicitly included** in each phase of the mapping process, with support from male advocates and leaders.

  Here is a look into what each community will focus on:


  **Tanzania Development Trust (Tanzania)**: The Tanzania Development Trust (TDT) is working to reduce incidence of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) and child marriage in rural parts of Tanzania. Over the next year, TDT aims to train 400 community members in rural areas, and set up a local YouthMappers community to support them.

  **Geochicas (Paraguay)**: Geochicas is empowering and training women across Latin America to visualize gender inequality through data. In Paraguay, Geochicas will work to train 100 community members in mapping key indicators of vulnerability for women, such as informal shelters and reproductive health services. Geochicas will also work to further their mission of increasing equality and participation in OpenStreetMap.

  **GAL (Peru)**: Peru has a very unequal society, and whilst parts of Peru are well mapped, these tend to be urban, wealthy areas that reflect the intersectional power relations at play in the country. HOT local partner GAL School Peru is training local high school students in Cusco to identify under-represented social issues, and then investigate, map and share them. To date, groups of school girls in Cusco have created campaigns that use maps of sexist publicity and behaviour, presenting them as part of an international festival and to local government representatives, as well as peers and the broader school community. GAL will train 150 youth in mapping gendered issues, and work with local mayors in the Cusco region to better understand the experiences of girls in society.
