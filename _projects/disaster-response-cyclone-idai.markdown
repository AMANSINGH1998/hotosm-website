On 13th March, the International Federation of the Red Cross/Red Crescent (IFRC) requested HOT to start mapping the flooded areas. Cyclone Idai had intensified and was causing heavy rains and floods in Mozambique and Malawi border region, eventually hitting the city of Beira, in the Sofala province. Here the storm caused massive flooding and widespread damage leaving much of the area destroyed and up to 600,000 people affected. IFRC needed information fast on what the situation looked like on the ground, and HOT deployed their team of volunteers to map it for them.
In the following days Médecins Sans Frontières also launched projects for the area impacted in Zimbabwe, which had by then expanded out to impact the wider region. 

**What has HOT done?**
In the first nine days, nearly 850 HOT mappers added over one million data points to the map of the affected area, providing critical geographical information responders will use to understand the extent of flooding and plan response activities.
