Six days before [Cyclone Idai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Idai) made landfall in Mozambique, the Activation Working Group started preparing for what was shaping up to be a monster storm. However, before it made landfall as Cyclone Idai, it was Tropical Depression 11 and had formed just off the coast further north. Although the first landfall was not as destructive, it brought heavy rains and eventually floods to a large area around the Mozambique and Malawi borders. On March 13th, a request from the International Federation of the Red Cross, Red Crescent was received and quickly mapping projects for the flooded areas were launched.

After exiting Mozambique, intensifying in strength, and making landfall again near the city of Beira, in the Sofala province; the storm caused massive flooding as well as storm surge and wind damage. Leaving much of the area completely destroyed. Cyclone Idai continued to cross Mozambique into Zimbabwe causing massive destruction there as well. On the 16th of March our partners at Médecins Sans Frontières launched projects for the area impacted in Zimbabwe and by the 19th more projects covering the majority of the impacted area were launched.
