This program will provide small grants to spark or support HOT/OpenStreetMap (OSM) community-led projects by sponsoring basic costs of mapping, from GPS devices, phones and laptops to transportation and internet connectivity. The micro-grants program will launch in 2017 to support local leaders who are transforming their countries by creating more complete maps and building local OSM capacity.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>
