To deal with the devastating after-effects of the 2017 Bangladesh floods, HOT initiated an activation “South Asian Flood Activation” to support aid agencies. Led by the Bangladesh HumanitarianOpenStreetMap Operation Team (BHOOT), the OSM Bangladesh community started mapping residential areas and connecting roads of affected areas to enable aid agencies to support affected populations and improve future response mechanisms.
