The escalating impacts of natural hazards are caused mostly by increasing exposure of populations and assets. It is estimated that the world will see the construction of 1 billion new dwellings by 2050 and this growth may lead to rapid increase in risk.

HOT is working together with the British Geological Survey (BGS), ImageCat, and the Global Earthquake Model (GEM) on a UK Space Agency International Partnership Programme focused on developing innovative applications of earth observation  technologies to improve understanding of exposure to help minimise these risks.

METEOR is a project aimed at building local and global resilience through innovation in order to better identify risk and enable more effective decision-making, delivering exposure data for 48 of the least developed Official Development Assistance (ODA) countries.

METEOR has a specific focus on the countries of Nepal and Tanzania, with the partners of the project working closely with the National Society for Earthquake Technology (NSET) and the Disaster Management Department of the United Republic of Tanzania.
