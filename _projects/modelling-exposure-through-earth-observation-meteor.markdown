The escalating impacts of natural hazards are caused mostly by increasing exposure of populations and assets. It is estimated that the world will see the construction of 1 billion new dwellings by 2050 and this growth may lead to rapid increase in risk.

.: *UK Space Agency* :.

HOT is working together with the British Geological Survey, ImageCat, and the Global Earthquake Model on a UK Space Agency International Partnership Programme, focused on developing innovative applications of earth observation  technologies to improve understanding of exposure to help minimise these risks. The project aims to build and strengthen local and global resilience through innovation in order to better identify risk and enable more effective decision-making through the following objectives:

- Deliver exposure data for 46 of the least developed Official Development Assistance (ODA) countries
- Capacity-building of local decision makers to apply data and assess hazard exposure
- Create open protocols to develop critical exposure information from EO data

The exposure datasets will be tested and validated against surveyed information within the cities of Kathmandu and Dar es Salaam. Detailed attribute information following the [GED4ALL](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/GED4ALL) taxonomy developed as part of the GFDRR Challenge Fund, will be collected for buildings randomly selected within homogenous zones by Kathmandu Living Labs and Ramani Huria for their cities.

METEOR is also working closely with the National Society for Earthquake Technology of Nepal and the Disaster Management Department of the United Republic of Tanzania to ensure that the project is effectively received by local partners.
