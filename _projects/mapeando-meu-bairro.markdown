Mapeando Meu Bairro have been working to preserve the cultural heritage of Mafalala in Mozambique. 
Mafalala was originally built to house “people of colour” during the Portuguese colonial period. The urban fabric was deliberately built poorly, including houses built of low quality materials with narrow streets. This intent for segregation, resulted in the opposite: Mafalala became an area of revolution, art and literature. Mapeando Meu Bairro have been capturing this unique historic and urban environment to display as data on a maps and preserve the regions heritage.
