<p>Through a small prototype grant by the Knight Foundation, the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team and key partners created OSM Analytics, an online platform for real time analysis and visualization of the OpenStreetMap database. This application allows anyone to display quantity and distribution of common map features such as roads and buildings. Data is visualized on a map where users can define custom areas of interest and dynamically obtain summary statistics. A time graph also allows to display when selected map data was added or last edited in OSM and to filter the results by specified date ranges.</p>
