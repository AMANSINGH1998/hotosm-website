There are promising potentials for machine/deep/statistical learning assisted mapping. Especially when it comes to image processing the achievements are tangible. HOT wants to pilot the use of the this machine leveraged power of the newly available programming models to improve data quality and mapping experience. In this project a well-designed use case around the Tasking Manager is to be implemented, which is focusing on machine learning assisted project creation and task facilitation.

We are teaming up with Microsoft, in order to provide an Open Source solution to include any kind of machine learning models into the Tasking Manager and other applications around OpenStreetMap.
